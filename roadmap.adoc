=== 1.0 Release

Stable release 1.0, expected in December 2014 / January 2015.

You can expect very good support on Groovy language. Almost all the things you love in groovy-core will be translated to
javascript. A closed list of Java types availables, with Java supported by Groovy. Some limitations on inheritance support,
in special the use of 'super' keyword.

Javascript converted code 'easy' to follow, tested on Node.js and modern browsers. Friendly javascript code, that
you can use directly from javascript.
