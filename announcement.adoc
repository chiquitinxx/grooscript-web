For me, it is a pleasure to announce link:index.html[grooscript] release 1.0.0 final. Grooscript is an open source
project, licensed under Apache-2, part of the amazing ecosystem around http://beta.groovy-lang.org/[Groovy] language.
Source code of the project is available on https://github.com/chiquitinxx/grooscript[Github].

Grooscript is a library that convert groovy or java code to javascript. You can explore main site for more
info or take a look at the link:doc.html[documentation]. You can get the library from
https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22grooscript%22[maven] or
https://bintray.com/chiquitinxx/grooscript/org.grooscript%3Agrooscript/view[bintray], adding it to
your project as any other jar library. There are also a gradle
http://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/org.grooscript.conversion[plugin], a grails
http://grails.org/plugin/grooscript[plugin] and a https://www.npmjs.com/package/grooscript[npm module] that
will improve your grooscript experience.

This project started around august 2012, around 1000 commits after, we are here. Is a little project,
with a few users, but we want moving forward with more people using it.
Each day more people show interest, more contributors adding, and there is nice stuff to do for next releases. Please,
spread grooscript around the world, we want to grow up, and improve the library each day.

Use groovy to create code that will run in your browser or in http://nodejs.org/[Node.js] is a new
experience. I invite you to try it, there are some guides in website to start with. I have created nice demos in
https://github.com/chiquitinxx/grooscript-demos[Github], don't be lazy and make your own. Explore javascript
with groovy is very fun, and it improves your skills in both worlds. Use DSL's, traits, AST's,
metaprogramming, ... will improve a lot your quality of life working with javascript.

I want to thank #groovylang and #grailsfw teams for all the help and time, without them grooscript would not exist.
Thank you to Guillaume and Jacob for include this project in their weeklies. Thank you
http://greachconf.com/[Greach] and http://gr8conf.eu/[Gr8Conf EU] for allowing me to show my english skills
at amazing conferences in 2014. Thank you all groovy community, all emails, all comments, ... every little bit helps
when you are working alone in an open source project. Special thanks to Ren√©, Mario, Serge, Abel and Alberto for time
spent on grooscript, I hope they continue contributing.

*It has been an awesome experience and I hope you enjoy it!*
